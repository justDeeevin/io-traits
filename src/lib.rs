//! Bring your own runtime!
//!
//! This crate provides a set of traits that abstract over common runtime-specific functionality,
//! including networking, fs, and synchronization primitives. It is intended to allow for libraries
//! to implement complex async behavior without locking its users into a specific runtime.
//!
//! Implementations are provided for [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio), [smol](https://docs.rs/smol), and [futures](https://docs.rs/futures). The traits can be easily
//! implemented for other runtimes.
